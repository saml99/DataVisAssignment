                <p class="description">
                    The visualisation to the left depicts the trajectory of waste items that were collected at varying
                    sites during Clean Up Australia day over the years of 2014 to 2019. Clean up Australia Day aims to
                    inspire communities to clean up, fix up and conserve the environment, yet what this visualisation
                    represents is the current trajectory of waste being collected each year as well as the disappointing
                    fact that waste continues to be as high if not higher than the previous year. The buttons below can
                    be used collapse and show the multiple site types which Clean Up Australia attend, in order to
                    compare the trajectory and amount each site collects for any given year. User's are also encouraged
                    to hover their cursor over the varying points on the line in order to display the accurate total for
                    the year.

                <h2>Size and Impact of Waste around Australia</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    The visualisation to the left depicts the overall size and impact of waste around Australia that was
                    collected at varying sites during Clean Up Australia Day over the years of 2014 to 2019. Clean Up
                    Australia Day aims to inspire communities to clean up, fix up and conserve the environment, yet this
                    visualisation represents the scale of which waste is being collected each year as well as the
                    devastating total of waste that can be collected over one day over four years. The User is
                    encouraged to hover their cursor over the individual colours in the bars to display the exact number
                    of waste collected at the specific site for the specific year.
